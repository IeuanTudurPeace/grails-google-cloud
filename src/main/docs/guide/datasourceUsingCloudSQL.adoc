As described in Using https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/flexible/java/using-cloud-sql[Cloud SQL]
with a Flexible Environment documentation, we need to add several runtime dependencies and configure
the production url to use the Cloud SQL MySQL database we created before.

Add MySQL dependencies; JDBC library and Cloud SQL MySQL Socket Factory.

[source,groovy]
.build.gradle
----
include::{sourceDir}/build.gradle[tag=msyql]
----

Replace the `production` environment `datasource` configuration to point to the
Cloud SQL MySQL database in `application.yml`

[source,yml]
.grails-app/conf/application.yml
----
environments:
include::{sourceDir}/grails-app/conf/application.yml[tag=datasourceProduction]
----

The production datasource url uses a custom url which is built with several components:

`jdbc:mysql://google/{DATABASE_NAME}?socketFactory=com.google.cloud.sql.mysql.SocketFactory&cloudSqlInstance={INSTANCE_NAME}&useSSL=true`

- **DATABASE_NAME** Use the database name you used when you created the database.

- **INSTANCE_NAME** You can find your instance name in your Cloud SQL instance details:

- **USERNAME / PASSWORD** For this guide, we are using username: `root` and
the password we entered when we created the SQL instance; see previous sections.

https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/cloud-sql-jdbc-socket-factory[Cloud SQL Socket Factory for JDBC drivers Github Repository]
contains a tool in `examples/getting-started` that can help generate the JDBC
URL and verify that connectivity can be established.
