As the home page of the application, we want to display the books persisted when the application starts;
those we saved in _BootStrap.groovy_

We map the home page to be resolved by `BookController` by modifying `UrlMappings.groovy`

Replace:

`grails-app/controllers/demo/UrlMappings.groovy`

    "/"(view:"/index")

with:

`grails-app/controllers/demo/UrlMappings.groovy`

    '/'(controller: 'book')

We have modified slightly the output of Grails static scaffolding command
`generate-all` to provide CRUD functionality for the domain class `Book`.

You can find the code: `BookController`, `BookGormService` and GSP views in
the initial project.
