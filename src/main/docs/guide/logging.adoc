We are going to use the version number of the serving app to check its logs.

**Application log messages written to stdout and stderr are automatically collected and can be viewed in the Logs Viewer.**

We are going to create a controller and log with level INFO and verify the log statement is visible in the Log Viewer.

[source,groovy]
./grails-app/controllers/demo/LegalController.groovy
----
include::{sourceDir}/grails-app/controllers/demo/LegalController.groovy[indent=0]
----

We configure logback:
[source,groovy]
./grails-app/conf/logback.groovy
----
include::{sourceDir}/grails-app/conf/logback.groovy[indent=0]
----

<1> Log INFO level statements of classes under package `demo` to `stdout` with additivity `false`

If you redeploy the app to app engine and hit the controller `/legal` end point you will see the logging statements in
Log Viewer.

read more about Logs in the Flexible Environment.

NOTE: Write your application logs using stdout for output and stderr for errors. Note that this does not provide log levels that you can use for filtering in the Logs Viewer; however, the Logs Viewer does provide other filtering, such as text, timestamp, etc.
