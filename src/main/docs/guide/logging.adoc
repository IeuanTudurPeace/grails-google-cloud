For the version which you would like to inspect, select Logs in the diagnose dropdown:

Application log messages written to stdout and stderr are automatically collected and can be
viewed in the Logs Viewer.

We are going to create a controller and log with level INFO and verify the log statement is
visible in the Log Viewer.


[source,groovy]
.grails-app/controllers/demo/LegalController.groovy
----
include::{sourceDir}/grails-app/controllers/demo/LegalController.groovy[]
----

We add the next line to `grails-app/conf/logback.groovy`

`logger 'demo', INFO, ['STDOUT'], false`

to log _INFO_ statements of classes under package _demo_ to _STDOUT_ appender with additivity _false_

If you redeploy the app to App Engine and access the _/legal_ end point, you will see the logging statements in Log Viewer.

Check https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/flexible/java/writing-application-logs[Writing Application Logs]
documentation to read more about logs in the Flexible Environment.

Write your application logs using stdout for output and stderr for errors. Note that this does not provide log levels that you can use for filtering in the Logs Viewer; however, the Logs Viewer does provide other filtering, such as text, timestamp, etc.
