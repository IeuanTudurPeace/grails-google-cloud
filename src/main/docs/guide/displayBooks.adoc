In the home page of application, we want to display the books persisted when the application started ( in `BootStrap.groovy`)

To keep this guide small, we are going to modify the default GSP `grails-app/views/index.gsp` and add a little code snippet to
display a list of book names.

Import the `Book` domain class.

[source,groovy]
./grails-app/views/index.gsp
----
include::{sourceDir}/grails-app/views/index.gsp[indent=0,lines=1]
----

Iterate the books:

[source,groovy]
./grails-app/views/index.gsp
----
include::{sourceDir}/grails-app/views/index.gsp[indent=0,lines=66..69]
----

NOTE: In a real Grails app you would encapsulte your GORM logic inside service and a controller will feed a model to your view; the GSP file
